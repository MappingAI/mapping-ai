---

## Phase 0: Setup
> See plan.md Phase 0

- [x] Create `.env` with `DATABASE_URL`, (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `EXA_API_KEY` for later use)
- [x] Set up Python venv + install dependencies (`psycopg2`, `anthropic`, `exa-py`, `python-dotenv`)
- [x] Verify DB connectivity to `mapping_ai_staging`

## Phase 1: Audit & Baseline
> See plan.md Phase 1

- [x] Write `enrichment/scripts/audit.py`
- [x] Run audit and save output to `enrichment/logs/baseline-audit.md`
- [x] Review baseline numbers, flag anything unexpected
- [x] Manual check of phase 1 outputs


## Phase 2: Mechanical Cleanup
> See plan.md Phase 2

**Citation artifacts:**
- [x] Write `cleanup_citations.py` — regex for `[n]`, `[n,n]` patterns in notes (05ba014)
- [x] Dry run, review output (05ba014)
- [x] Run live, log entity count + IDs changed — 300 entities updated, 1,375 citations removed (05ba014)

**Edge type normalization:**
- [x] Write `normalize_edges.py` — 24 legacy types to 12 canonical (861a4c3)
- [x] Dry run, review mapping output (5f8d11b)
- [x] Run live, log edge counts per type migration (13c1c49)

**Belief field normalization:**
- [x] Write `normalize_beliefs.py` — non-standard to canonical values
- [x] Dry run, review distinct values found
- [x] Run live, log counts — 113 entities updated (2 belief_agi_timeline, 111 belief_evidence_source)

- [x] Manual check of phase 2 changes to the staging database (logged in phase2_diff.md)


## Phase 3: Entity Enrichment
> See plan.md Phase 3

**Scripted enrichment tooling:**
- [x] Write `enrich_entity.py` (thin wrapper — delegates to enrich_batch.py --ids)
- [x] Write `enrich_batch.py` (batch wrapper with progress tracking) — handles single entity via `--ids` too
- [ ] Test on 5 entities, review output quality — **deferred**; manual Claude Code enrichment used instead (see batches 01-86)

**Manual enrichment — persons & organizations:**
- [x] Pull prioritized list by edge count descending — see `enrichment/docs/enrichment-queue.md`
- [x] Enrich top entities (3+ edges) — batches 01-27 (4 per agent)
- [x] Scale to 6-per-agent for 2+ edge tier — batches 28-43
- [x] Scale to 12-per-agent × 4 parallel agents for truly-empty entities — batches 44-81
- [x] Final totals: 293 orgs + 373 persons with `enrichment_version='phase3-manual'`

**Manual enrichment — resources:**
- [x] Enrich 92 empty resources (books, papers, bills, EOs, transcripts) — batches 82-85 (23 per agent)
- [x] 1-2 sentence descriptions; no belief fields (resources don't hold beliefs)

**Phase 3 close-out passes:**
- [x] Pass #1: Delete 5 test entities + expand 12 thin v1 stubs — batch 86
- [x] Pass #2: Dead URL cleanup — 2 real fixes, 35 audit flags confirmed as bot blocks — `logs/audit-url-cleanup-20260411.md`
- [x] Pass #3: Resource dedup — 11 merges across 6 canonical clusters, 1 edge redirected, 0 orphans — `logs/resource-dedup-20260411.md`
- [x] Pass #4: Category corrections — 2 applied (ASML, PIT-UN), 13 already in-batch, 1 held for schema (AMPTP) — `logs/category-corrections-20260411.md`
- [x] Pass #5: Audit finish — short-notes flags resolved; no-beliefs sample documented (6 policymaker backfills flagged for Phase 4) — `logs/audit-finish-20260411.md`

**NIST dedup:** consolidated 4 duplicate entities (911, 1309, 1416, 1468) into canonical 1309 with 10 edges merged.

**Orphan entities:** not explicitly triaged in Phase 3 — enrichment scope was coverage-first (notes ≥50 chars for all 1,651 entities). Orphan review deferred to Phase 4/5.

## Phase 4: Edge Enrichment
> See plan.md Phase 4

**Affiliated edge reclassification (591 edges):**
- [x] Sample affiliated edges, determine distribution — 59 party membership, 9 journalist-employer, 27 reversed org→person, 496 unresolved (see reclassify_affiliated.py report)
- [x] Rounds 1-3: 361 reclassified via deterministic rules (commits through 38e9e94)
- [x] Round 4: 47 reclassified (31 employer, 3 funder, 5 member, 6 parent_company, 2 advisor) + 12 deleted (8 duplicate founders + 4 personal relationship edges) via training knowledge — `logs/affiliated-reclassify-20260412.md`
- [ ] Round 5: 164 remaining `affiliated` edges — require web search per edge (legislators→OSTP/think tanks, persons→Tsinghua/AI Risk Mitigation Fund, suspicious role mismatches, no-evidence edges)

**Backfill missing edges from notes (Phase 4A):**
- [x] Write `backfill_employer_edges.py` — regex extraction of employment/founder/member patterns from person notes, with guards for past roles and duplicate-stub entities — `logs/backfill-employer-edges-20260412.md`
- [x] Live run: **48 edges added** (23 employer + 17 founder + 8 member) across 46 persons
- [x] Flag delta: 271 → 249 `influence_without_edge` (−22)
- [x] Phase 4A.3: Org-side backfill via `backfill_org_edges.py` (mirror — scans ORG notes for named leadership; R1 founded-by, R2 led/run-by, R3 role-then-name, R4 name-then-paren-role). Added disambiguation guard ("distinct from…") and `affiliated` to blocking set — `logs/backfill-org-edges-20260412.md`
- [x] Live run: **9 edges added** (2 founder + 7 employer) across 9 orgs; 20 proposals skipped (edge already exists)
- [x] Flag delta: 338 → 334 orgs `influence_without_edge` (−4). Lower yield than person-side because most named leaders in org notes aren't yet person entities in the DB.

**Edge directionality + correctness:**
- [x] Spot-check edges against canonical direction conventions — violations found:
  - `employer` (9): target not org — 8x person→person "worked for [person]", 1x person→resource
  - `founder` (5): source not person — org→org spin-off relationships, need manual reclassification
  - `founder` (20): target not org — 18x person→person co-founder, 2x person→resource
  - `advisor` (10): source not person — 8x org→person (reversed), 2x org→org (should be partner)
  - `member` (1): source not person — 1 edge
  - `critic` (6): source not person
  - `supporter` (3): source not person
- [x] Phase 4B.1: Flipped 7 reversed `advisor` org→person edges via `fix_edge_directions.py --live` — `logs/phase4b1-4e-20260412.md`
- [x] Manual review: 3 org→org `advisor` edges → reclassified to `partner`; 9 non-person-source `critic`/`supporter` edges reviewed, all semantically valid, no change — `logs/advisor-edge-reclassify-20260412.md`
- [ ] Manual review: founder person→person edges, employer person→person edges (see Discovered Work)

**Phase 4E close-outs (completed 2026-04-12):**
- [x] Citation artifact cleanup — 16 entities, 63 markers stripped (fixed `cleanup_citations.py` regex bug)
- [x] Dead URL removal — 4 URLs (federalregister 500, whitehouse 404, darioamodei 404, helionenergy DNS)
- [x] Belief backfill for 6 policymakers (Tom Cotton, Andy Kim, Ben Horowitz, Donald Trump, John Kennedy, Katie Britt)

**Source URLs and evidence:**
- [x] Phase 4C.1: Zero-API backfill via `backfill_source_urls.py --live` — filled **1,842 / 2,269 edges (81.2%)** using target_resource_url → target_website → source_website fallbacks — `logs/source-url-backfill-20260412.md`
- [x] Phase 4C.2a: Re-ran zero-API backfill after Phase 5 seeding — picked up 14 new fills from org-websites added during Tier B/D/F/G (worldlabs, hai.stanford, whitehouse/OSTP, justice.gov, etc.). Coverage **1,923 / 2,331 (82.5%)** — `logs/source-url-backfill-20260413.md`
- [ ] Phase 4C.2b: 408 remaining unfilled edges exhaust zero-cost strategies (collaborator 175, employer 60, founder 33, member 29, advisor 24, affiliated 19, partner 17, supporter 15, author 12, critic 10, funder 9, parent_company 4, mentioned 1). No URLs embedded in `evidence` text (checked 389 non-empty evidence fields — zero hits). Requires per-edge web research — deferred pending scope decision.
- [ ] Phase 4C.3 (stretch): Upgrade generic org-homepage URLs to specific evidence pages for high-degree entities

## Phase 5: Seeding
> See plan.md Phase 5

**Phase 5A: Gap analysis (complete):**
- [x] Write `scripts/gap_analysis.py` — category counts, exec coverage, orphans, watchlist
- [x] Run gap analysis — `logs/gap-analysis-20260412.md`
- [x] Draft prioritized seeding queue — `docs/seeding-queue.md`
- [x] Surfaced: 7 canonical orgs missing (Cohere, Inflection, CAISI, BIS, NSC, PCAST, State Dept AI); 5 orgs with zero leadership edges (AISI, DoD, OMB, CSIS, CAIP); 52 resources mis-categorized as non-canonical "AI Policy"; Nancy Pelosi missing from watchlist; FTC duplicate (199 v2 + 909 phase3-manual)

**Phase 5A.x: Tier A zero-token cleanup (complete):**
- [x] Resource category normalization — 57 rows updated: 52 "AI Policy"→"AI Governance", 2 "AI Safety, Philosophy/Ethics"→"AI Safety", 1 "AI Safety, Policy Proposal"→"AI Safety", 1 "Ethics"→"Philosophy/Ethics", 1 "Media"→"Industry Analysis" — `logs/normalize-resources-20260412.md`
- [x] Influence-type normalization — 91 rows updated; ~22 non-canonical token variants folded into the 9 canonical types (Electoral→Decision-maker, Researcher→Researcher/analyst, Technical leader→Builder, Convener→Connector/convener, Policy advocate→Organizer/advocate, Public intellectual/Thought leader/Educator→Narrator, etc.) — `logs/normalize-influence-types-20260412.md`
- [x] FTC duplicate merge — entity 199 → 909; 5 edges redirected, 12 notes_sources URLs appended, 199 deleted; 909 now has 17 edges — `logs/ftc-merge-20260412.md`
- [x] 3 zero-research leadership edges — Paul Christiano→AISI (employer/Head of AI Safety), Thomas Larsen→CAIP (employer/Director of Policy), Alan Davidson→Commerce (member/NTIA Admin) — `logs/seed-known-edges-20260412.md`
- [x] Deferred: CSIS (entity 349) — needs note rewrite, not mechanical fix. Documented in `seeding-queue.md` for Phase 5C.

**Phase 5B: Seeding script (complete):**
- [x] Write `seed_entity.py` — library that takes spec dicts; inserts entity + edges in one transaction, dry-run default, pre-flight duplicate + endpoint check
- [x] Seed 6 canonical orgs via `seed_tier_b.py` — `logs/tier-b-seeding-20260412.md`

  - [1788] Inflection AI (+2 founder edges: Suleyman, Hoffman)
  - [1789] Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) (+parent_company → Commerce)
  - [1790] National Security Council (NSC) (+parent_company → White House)
  - [1791] PCAST (+parent_company → White House)
  - [1792] Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy (CDP) (+parent_company → State Dept)
- [x] Skipped with reasoning: CAISI (uncertain post-Trump-admin status), Nancy Pelosi (doesn't pass ONBOARDING "don't add randos" bar for AI-specific policy)

**Phase 5C: Tier C — Leadership persons for existing orgs (complete):**
- [x] Extended `seed_entity.py` to handle person-specific fields (title, primary_org, influence_type, beliefs, twitter, location, etc.)
- [x] Seeded 9 leadership persons via `seed_tier_c.py` — `logs/tier-c-seeding-20260412.md`

- [x] "Technical" resource bucket now populated (was 0)
- [ ] "Industry Analysis" bucket now empty (the one row was deleted as test data in Phase 5 tail — see `logs/delete-547-20260412.md`); Chip War, SemiAnalysis, Stratechery, State of AI reports are candidates for a future seeding pass

**Phase 5F: Tier F — Current-admin gov leads + frontier-lab executives (complete):**
- [x] Seeded 17 persons via `seed_tier_f.py` — `logs/tier-f-seeding-20260412.md`

- [x] Research verified via WebSearch/WebFetch; all current-admin appointees confirmed as of early 2026

**Phase 5G: Tier G — Journalists + cultural figures + media orgs (complete):**
- [x] Seeded 19 entities via `seed_tier_g.py` — `logs/tier-g-seeding-20260412.md`
  - Media orgs (3): Reuters [1829], Semafor [1830], Forbes [1831]
  - Journalists (12): Kylie Robison [1832], Hayden Field [1833], Deepa Seetharaman [1834], Berber Jin [1835], Alex Heath [1836], Nilay Patel [1837], Reed Albergotti [1838], Shirin Ghaffary [1839], Anna Tong [1840], Ben Thompson [1841], Sigal Samuel [1842], Garrison Lovely [1843]

**Phase 5F/G tail — remaining:**
- [x] Verify Investor tagging for Hoffman, Andreessen, Thiel, Khosla — all four already `category=Investor` with `Funder/investor` leading their `influence_type`. Backfilled missing `primary_org` on Hoffman (→Greylock Partners) and Khosla (→Khosla Ventures). Edge-coverage gaps on Hoffman/Khosla logged to Discovered Work. `logs/investor-audit-20260412.md`
- [x] Update entity 205 (AISI) notes to reflect June 3 2025 → CAISI rebrand — renamed to "Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI)", notes rewritten (mission pivot, Kelly departure, no confirmed successor), notes_sources refreshed, 12 existing edges preserved. `logs/caisi-rebrand-20260412.md`
- [x] Resolve Industry Analysis resource bucket — the single resource [547] "The Hard Fork Podcast" turned out to be v1-era test data (notes literally = "TEST DATA — NYT podcast…") with a malformed `employer` edge from Casey Newton→podcast. Deleted the entity + both edges. Bucket is now empty by design; a future pass can populate it with genuine industry-analysis resources (Chip War, SemiAnalysis, Stratechery archive, State of AI reports, etc.). `logs/delete-547-20260412.md`

## Phase 6: Importance Ratings
> See plan.md Phase 6

- [ ] Coordinate `ALTER TABLE` with team
- [ ] Run `ALTER TABLE` on staging (add `importance` column)
- [ ] Write `importance.py` (AI-assisted scoring)
- [ ] Rate all person categories, cross-calibrate
- [ ] Rate all org categories, cross-calibrate
- [ ] Rate resources
- [ ] Final cross-category calibration pass
